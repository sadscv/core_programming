Former captain Anil Kumble is impressed by the Indian team's performance against the visiting Australians in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy and is looking forward to a clean sweep in the four-Test series.
"It will be a great thing. To beat Australia, forget Australia, let alone any Test series to win 4-0 is something very special. So India has an opportunity to achieve that. And it is great to see everyone doing really well at the moment. I'm looking forward to a 4-0 victory," Kumble said here.
India are leading the four-match series 3-0, with the final game going on at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground in New Delhi.
The former legspinner lavished praise on Shikhar Dhawan, who notched up the fastest-ever Test century on debut in the third Test.
The former legspinner lavished praise on Delhi opener Shikhar Dhawan, who notched up the fastest-ever Test century on debut in the third Test in Mohali.
"He played brilliantly. It is unfortunate that he is not playing in this game, (in his) hometown (because of injury). I really watched that (Mohali innings).... Fantastic batting."
"To go out there and just play the way he did in his first game was impressive. That really augurs well. There are some tough tours coming up, so this confidence will certainly help the youngsters," he said.
"India has done well to beat Australia (in the series). They (Australia) have put up scores close to 400 in the first innings but haven't backed it up. India has done well. Everyone has bowled well, batted well," Kumble added.
Asked to compare the current tourists with the Australian teams he had played against, Kumble said the earlier squads were highly competitive ones.
"You can't really compare but 2004, 2008, 1996, 1998...I think those teams that I played against were extremely competitive. (They) Probably (were the) number one team for a long time. I think that says a lot."
