Born and brought up in New Delhi, Archana Kavi made a dream debut with Neelathamara, a Malayalam film based on M T Vasudevan Nair's story, directed by Lal Jose. She was acclaimed for her performance and won a number of state awards in Kerala.

Acting happened by accident for Archana, who is now doing films in Malayalam and Tamil.

Her first Telugu film, Back Bench Student, directed by Madhura Sreedhar Reddy, and co-starring Mahat Raghavendra and Piaa Bajpai, released on Friday, March 15. 

Archana talks about her experience of working in Back Bench Student.

Why did you decide to foray into Telugu films when you are an established actress in Malayalam cinema?

I'm not choosy about the language. I want to do as many languages as I can. It's nice to be part of different cultures.

A college kid in Tamil, Malayalam or Telugu has different shades. I go for performance oriented roles. If you have seen my Malayalam films, I have played characters like a maid and an adivasi.

When I heard the narration of Back Bench Student, I thought it would portray me as I was. I had the scope to perform in this role, so I took it up.
