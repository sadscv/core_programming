Bipasha Basu is one of the friendliest actresses in the film industry.

Even when she's having a bad day -- it certainly was a very tiring day for the actress, who spent an entire day giving endless interviews and promoting her film Aatma, which releases today, at the Westin hotel in Gurgaon -- Bipasha makes sure to flash a warm smile and offer you a drink (in this case, green tea).

When a staffer tries to empty a packet of sugar into her green tea without asking her first, she doesn't throw a tantrum. She politely waves her hand and says, 'Thank you' and then good-naturedly, rolls her eyes at me.

When Patcy N met up with her earlier -- at the Taj Lands End hotel in Mumbai -- Bipasha chatted happily, admired Patcy's multiple earrings while lamenting about her navel piercing that had caused her much pain when it was done ("I blacked out because of the pain!").

Bipasha gets candid about Aatma, and the woman that she is, with Patcy N and Ronjita Kulkarni, in interviews held in different cities, and at different times.

What is this fascination with horror movies?

There is no fascination. I am just fascinated by a good film and a great role. I do not want to be an accessory in a film any more.

I want to do films in which I have something to do. It just happened that this was the best role I got.

The others were very frivolous; I just had to look pretty. I've done that for 13 years, and don't want to do it again.

I may do it after a break, but now I want to do something more content-driven.
