Hollywood is fascinated with the subject of The White House under threat and the Koreans attacking them. This is evident with the kind of films that they have been churning out.
Earlier in December 2012, there was a low budget film called 'Red Dawn' and now jampacked with A-list stars, 'Olympus Has Fallen', and soon to follow this June would be 'White House Down', all the three films deal with nearly the same subject.
But unlike 'Red Dawn', the stakes are much bigger and the canvas wider in 'Olympus Has Fallen'. It's the story of the loyal ex-handler of the President and a Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who while protecting President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), takes on the North Korean terrorists who besiege the most protected building in the world - The White House. It is also reminiscent of a similar attack by the British in 1812.
The once favourite handler of the President, Mike is relegated to desk duty in the Treasury Department after a tragedy involving the first family. But 18 months later, when North Korean terrorists headed by Kang Yeonsak (Rick Yune) storm the White House, Mike finds himself racing from the Treasury to the White House to see what's going on.
