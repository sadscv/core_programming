Directed by Supern Verma, 'Aatma' stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Bipasha Basu and Doyel Dhawan in the lead roles. The film is about a doting father who wants to live with his daughter even after his death.
Nawazuddin is playing a complex character in 'Aatma' that is required to display a wide range of emotions. On the other hand, the film is going to be a challenge for Bipasha Basu as well, who will have to compete with the acting capabilities of Nawazuddin. She is playing a mother who wants to protect her child from evil forces.
The makers of 'Aatma' have promoted it as a psychological thriller which can work in favour of the film because the modern day audience wants something more than a mere horror film.
The Hindi film industry has evolved a lot in recent years and a film based on just visual effects is not likely to go down well with the viewers, so Suparn Verma will have to create an enticing and believable world.
