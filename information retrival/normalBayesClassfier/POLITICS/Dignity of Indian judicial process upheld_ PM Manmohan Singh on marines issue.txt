Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today welcomed Italy's decision to send back its two marines to face trial in India, saying the integrity and dignity of Indian judicial process has been upheld.

"I am happy that the integrity and dignity of the Indian judicial process has been upheld," Singh told media persons in Parliament House complex hours after Italy reversed its decision of not sending back the marines who are facing trial for killing two Kerala fishermen in February last year.

Earlier, when Italy refused to send back the marines, Singh had warned that the move will have consequences for bilateral relations.

Terming Italy's decision of March 11 as "unacceptable", he had accused that country of violating "every rule of diplomatic discourse".

He had urged the Italian authorities to respect the "solemn commitments" given to the Supreme Court and return the two accused - Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone - within the four-week time frame which expires today.
