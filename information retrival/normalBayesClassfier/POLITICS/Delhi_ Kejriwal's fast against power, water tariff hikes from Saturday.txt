Aam Aadmi Party convenor Arvind Kejriwal will launch an indefinite fast on Saturday to protest against the tariff hikes on electricity and water supply in the capital. The protest, being hailed as a civil disobedience movement by many, will seek to enlist mass support in defying the government by refusing to pay the bills.
More importantly, the protest will be held in a slum area in the capital, Sundernagari, from where Kejriwal will also address the Wharton School's India Economic Forum.
The Forum had earlier invited Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for a keynote address. However, following protests from a section of the students and staff members, his address was cancelled.
