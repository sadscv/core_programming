When the Samajwadi Party first took up Union steel minister Beni Prasad Verma's disparaging remarks against Mulayam Singh Yadav on Monday, senior Congress managers requested Verma to apologise. But Verma walked away from the meeting, saying he would prefer to resign instead.

So it was left to parliamentary affairs minister Kamal Nath to apologise, and Verma gave in only after Sonia Gandhi also apologised to Mulayam. Those who have tracked Verma over the years say the episode is characteristic of the man. He does not beat around the bush and generally stands by what he says.

In the winter session of Parliament in 2009, he made some disparaging remarks about former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had to apologise on his behalf.

The UPA got a taste of his ways in January 2011 when he was about to be made a minister. Verma told cabinet secretary K M Chandrasekhar he would not attend the swearing-in ceremony after he realised he would be made a minister of state with independent charge while he had been a cabinet minister in the United Front government.

He relented only after Ahmed Patel pacified him and promised that he would be given an important position soon. Two months later, Verma, a Socialist from Uttar Pradesh who swore by Ram Manohar Lohia and Chaudhary Charan Singh, was inducted into the Congress Working Committee as a permanent invitee. And in July 2011, he was made a cabinet minister.

Verma's rise in the Congress is attributed to Rahul Gandhi's desperation to get the better of the identity politics of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayawati in Uttar Pradesh. Verma is a Kurmi and was a crucial sounding board for Rahul as he sought to strike the right social composition in the candidate selection for UP elections in 2012.
