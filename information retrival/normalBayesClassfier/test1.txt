Exactly seven years ago, on March 21, 2006, Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, posted the first ever tweet. "just setting up my twttr," read the tweet from @jack. At only 24 characters, the first tweet was way within Twitter's 140 character limit.
The reason Jack Dorsey mentions Twitter as twttr is because that was the original code name for the project. The public launch of what was to soon become the world's most popular microblogging platform happened a few months later on July 15, 2006.
It's been seven years and billions of tweets since that first tweet but within those billions of tweets there are some firsts that will always remain so. Here are a selection of seven first-of-its-kind tweets on the seventh anniversary of the first tweet.
