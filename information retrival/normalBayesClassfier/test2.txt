Even as filmmakers are revisiting old blockbusters of the 80s and 90s, actress Sonam Kapoor says that she is not particularly fond of movies made in that period but would love to do Anil Kapoor-Madhuri Dixit starrer 'Tezaab'.
"I am not a huge fan of 80s and 90s as they were hero centric. If I had to play a role now it has to be of a hero. So if anything had to be remade I would love to be Ms India if not Mr India. I would love to play male characters," Sonam told PTI.
"I would love to do 'Tezaab' again," she said. Her father Anil Kapoor ruled Bollywood at that time with films like 'Tezaab', 'Beta', 'Lamhe', and 'Mr India'among others.
The 27-year-old actress is currently shooting for Yash Raj Films untitled project with Ayushmann Khurrana. "We have already finished the first schedule of the film. I am very happy the way things are going on," she said.
She will also be sporting a bikini in an untitled film which is being helmed by director Nupur Asthana.
When asked about her reservations earlier, she said, "My body was not ready to wear swim suit and I was honest and direct about it. Whether I wear it or not is nobody's business. Is it a big deal like me wearing a bikini?"
