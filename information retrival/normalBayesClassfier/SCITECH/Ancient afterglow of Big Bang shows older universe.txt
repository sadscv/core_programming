New results from a look into the split second after the Big Bang indicate the universe is a bit older than previously thought but the core concepts of the cosmos how it began, what it's made of and where it's going seem to be on the right track.

The findings bolster a key theory called inflation, which says the universe burst from subatomic size to its now-observable expanse in a fraction of a second.

George Esfthathiou, an astrophysicist who announced the Planck satellite mapping on Thursday, says the findings also offer new specificity of the universe's composition. He says it is made up of slightly more ordinary matter and less of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy.
