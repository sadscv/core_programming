Playboy's publisher, Sanoma, brought the case against Dutch company GS Media in 2011
The European Court of Justice has ruled in favour of Playboy in a long-running case over hyperlinks to copyrighted content.
The Dutch website Geenstijl, operated by GS Media, had posted links to an Australian site that was hosting photographs from Playboy.
But the court ruled GS Media had broken copyright rules, in part because it was motivated by profit.
GS Media said this was a blow to the "free internet".
Playboy's publisher, Sanoma, first brought the case against GS Media over links to photos of Dutch TV personality Britt Dekker, in 2011.
7. In April 2016, EU advocate general Melchior Wathelet sided with GS Media, arguing in his legal opinion to the court that posting the hyperlinks did not constitute copyright infringement.
